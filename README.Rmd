# WARDEN: Workflows for health technology Assessments in R using Discrete EveNts

## Introduction
`WARDEN` is a user-friendly package that facilitates the use of discrete event simulations without resource constraints for cost-effectiveness analysis.
The package supports a flexible, practical approach to discrete event simulation while keeping an acceptable performance through the use of parallel computing.

The current version supports:

* Discrete event simulation models, Markov/semi-Markov models and hybrid models using parallel and non-parallel engines
* Seamlessly integrating data.frames and other objects into the model
* Delayed execution of the main inputs to facilitate readability of the model
* Implementation of structural and parameter uncertainty
* Helper functions to facilitate drawing of time to events and the use of hazard ratios
* Performing cost-effectiveness and uncertainty analysis

It is recommended that the user checks the vignettes, first the simple [Sick-Sicker-Dead model](https://jsanchezalv.github.io/WARDEN/articles/example_ssd.html) and then the more complex model for [early breast cancer](https://jsanchezalv.github.io/WARDEN/articles/example_eBC.html). The [markov](https://jsanchezalv.github.io/WARDEN/articles/example_markov.html) example shows how to run a cohort Markov model while using the same modeling framework. Similarly, a simulation based Markov model could be run. Structural and parametric uncertainty are explored in the [corresponding vignette](https://jsanchezalv.github.io/WARDEN/articles/example_uncertainty.html). The [IPD vignette](https://jsanchezalv.github.io/WARDEN/articles/example_ipd.html) shows how WARDEN can be used when individual patient data is available.
