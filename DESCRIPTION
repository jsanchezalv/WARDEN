Description: Toolkit to support and perform discrete event simulations without
    resource constraints in the context of health technology assessments (HTA).
    The package focuses on cost-effectiveness modelling and aims to be submission-ready
    to relevant HTA bodies in alignment with 'NICE TSD 15'
    <https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/nice-dsu/tsds/patient-level-simulation>.
